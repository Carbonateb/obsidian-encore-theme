# Encore â€¢ Obsidian Remade

> [!NOTE]
>
> ### **Encore** _[ahn-kohr]_
>
> _Adverb (French)_  
> Means "again"
>
> I chose this name for the theme as my goal was to refresh and refine the default Obsidian experience - an encore of the default theme.

Unlike most themes, Encore's initial visual impact is subtle. Its focus is on **cleaning up** the UI, **refining typography**, and enhancing the **visual hierarchy** of Obsidian. This creates a more streamlined and intuitive experience. You'll also find subtle, **delightful** design elements sprinkled throughout. Encore makes no changes to the app's core layout, ensuring your workflow remains familiar.

Encore also supports a number of popular plugins

- Dataview
- Make.md
- Calendar
- Kanban
- Projects
- Canvas

Some of them have been given a considerable facelift, such as the Dataview plugin (See an example near the bottom of this page)

## ðŸ‘‘ Encore Translucency

With the removal of translucency mode from Windows, I have added an alternative way to get that translucent aesthetic back in your vault. Encore allows you to set a background image via URL, or pick from a handful of (subtly) animated options for even more style.
