# Encore â€¢ Obsidian Remade

> [!NOTE]

> ## **Encore**

> _Adverb (French)_

> I named the theme like this as my goal was to redo the default theme.

Unlike most other themes, when you first install Encore you'll notice that the colours are nearly identical. Instead, this theme aims to **clean up** the UI and **typography** of Obsidian, tweak the **visual hierarchy** and sprinkle little bits of **delightful** elements across the interface. Encore makes _no changes_ to the layout of the app, to keep your muscle memory intact.

Encore also supports a number of popular plugins

- Dataview
- Make.md
- Calendar
- Kanban
- Projects
- Canvas

Some of them have been given a considerable facelift, such as the Dataview plugin (See an example near the bottom of this page)

## ðŸ‘‘ Encore Translucency

With the removal of translucency mode from Windows, I have added an alternative way to get that translucent aesthetic back in your vault. Encore allows you to set a background image via URL, or pick from a handful of (subtly) animated options for even more style.
