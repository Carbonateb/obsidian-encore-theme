# Encore - Obsidian Reimagined

Encore is a project that aims to rework how Obsidian looks and feels, while placing a huge emphasis on usability and ergonomics.

**Color Theme: Cobalt (Default)**  
The reworked workspaces. Opting for floating tabs allows me to do a bunch of cool things :)  
Notice the much more relaxed typography. Don't worry about the red and green colours, I customized those locally via style settings - you'll see later.

**Color Theme: Mercury**  
The command palette has been given way more oomph, and you can now see more commands at once!

![Canvas support](images/preview-encore-carbon.webp)
**Color Theme: Carbon**  
Canvas is fully supported

![Customisation](images/preview-encore-rgb.webp)
**Color Theme: RGB**  
You can customise the colours easily using the style settings plugin. And yes, I unironically made an RGB theme. Yes, it's animated. No, I'm not sorry. Definitely check out the command palette with this theme on though ;)

**Color Theme: RGB**  
Translucent mode has been given a lot of love - here it is working on the RGB theme

![Light theme](images/preview-encore-sterling.webp)
**Color Theme: Sterling**  
The only light theme so far. It still needs a bit more work, but it's servicable at least, for all you flashbang lovers.

## And More

There's also support for a bunch of popular plugins, like the Calendar, Excalidraw, Kanban, Obsidian Projects. Support for other plugins might come, depends on what I'm using.
